        <h2>Common Mental Health Conditions</h2>
        <p>Mental health conditions are medical conditions that affect thoughts, feelings, mood, and behavior. They're more common than you might think, and they're treatable.</p>

        <div class="condition-card">
            <h3>Depression</h3>

        <div class="condition-card">

            <h3>Stress and Burnout</h3>
            <p>While stress is a normal part of life, chronic stress can lead to burnout and affect both mental and physical health.</p>
            <p><strong>Common signs include:</strong></p>

        <h3>You Are Not Alone</h3>
        <p>According to the National Institute of Mental Health, 1 in 5 U.S. adults experience mental illness each year. That's over 50 million people. Mental health conditions don't discriminate—they can affect anyone regardless of age, gender, race, or background.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Breaking the Stigma</h2>
        <p>One of the biggest barriers to getting help is stigma—the shame or judgment people fear when talking about mental health. Here's the truth:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mental health conditions are real medical conditions</strong>, just like diabetes or heart disease</li>
            <li><strong>Seeking help is a sign of strength</strong>, not weakness</li>
            <li><strong>Treatment works</strong> for the majority of people who seek it</li>
            <li><strong>Recovery is possible</strong> with the right support and care</li>
            <li><strong>You deserve support</strong> no matter what you're going through</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>When to Seek Help</h2>
        <p>Consider reaching out to a mental health professional if you notice:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Symptoms lasting more than two weeks</li>
            <li>Difficulty performing daily tasks or meeting responsibilities</li>
            <li>Changes in sleep, appetite, or energy levels</li>
            <li>Withdrawing from friends, family, or activities</li>
            <li>Thoughts of self-harm or suicide</li>
            <li>Turning to substances to cope</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Remember:</strong> You don't have to wait until things are "bad enough" to seek help. Early intervention can make a significant difference.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3>It Gets Better</h3>
        <p>Recovery looks different for everyone, but with proper treatment and support, most people with mental health conditions improve and many recover completely. Treatment may include therapy, medication, lifestyle changes, or a combination of approaches. The most important step is reaching out.</p>
