        <h2>Common Mental Health Conditions</h2>
        <p>Mental health conditions are medical conditions that affect thoughts, feelings, mood, and behavior. In Kenya, 1 in 4 adults are affected annually (WHO, 2025), and they're treatable with local support.</p>

        <div class="condition-card">
            <h3>Depression</h3>
            <p>Depression is more than just feeling sad. It's a serious medical condition that affects how you feel, think, and handle daily activities. In Kenya, it's one of the leading causes.</p>
            <p><strong>Common signs include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Persistent sad, anxious, or empty mood</li>
                <li>Loss of interest in activities once enjoyed</li>
                <li>Changes in sleep patterns or appetite</li>

                <li>Feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="condition-card">
            <h3>Anxiety Disorders</h3>
            <p>Anxiety disorders involve more than temporary worry or fear. They can interfere with daily activities and relationships, affecting many in Kenyan communities.</p>
            <p><strong>Common signs include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Excessive worry that's hard to control</li>
                <li>Restlessness or feeling on edge</li>

                <li>Avoiding situations that cause anxiety</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="condition-card">
            <h3>Stress and Burnout</h3>
            <p>While stress is a normal part of life, chronic stress can lead to burnout and affect both mental and physical health, especially in fast-paced Kenyan urban areas.</p>
            <p><strong>Common signs include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Feeling overwhelmed or exhausted</li>
                <li>Difficulty concentrating</li>
                <li>Physical symptoms like headaches or muscle tension</li>
                <li>Irritability or mood swings</li>
                <li>Withdrawing from responsibilities</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3>You Are Not Alone</h3>
        <p>According to the Kenya Ministry of Health and WHO, 1 in 4 Kenyan adults experience mental illness each year. That's millions of people. Mental health conditions don't discriminate—they can affect anyone regardless of age, gender, tribe, or background.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Breaking the Stigma</h2>
        <p>One of the biggest barriers to getting help in Kenya is stigma—the shame or judgment people fear when talking about mental health. Here's the truth:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mental health conditions are real medical conditions</strong>, just like diabetes or heart disease</li>
            <li><strong>Seeking help is a sign of strength</strong>, not weakness</li>
            <li><strong>Treatment works</strong> for the majority of people who seek it, including free services via 1193</li>
            <li><strong>Recovery is possible</strong> with the right support and care from local clinics</li>
            <li><strong>You deserve support</strong> no matter what you're going through</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>When to Seek Help</h2>
        <p>Consider reaching out to a mental health professional if you notice:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Symptoms lasting more than two weeks</li>
            <li>Difficulty performing daily tasks or meeting responsibilities</li>
            <li>Changes in sleep, appetite, or energy levels</li>
            <li>Withdrawing from friends, family, or activities</li>
            <li>Thoughts of self-harm or suicide</li>
            <li>Turning to substances to cope</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Remember:</strong> You don't have to wait until things are "bad enough" to seek help. Call 1193 for free support. Early intervention can make a significant difference.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3>It Gets Better</h3>
        <p>Recovery looks different for everyone, but with proper treatment and support from Kenyan organizations like Befrienders Kenya, most people with mental health conditions improve and many recover completely. Treatment may include therapy, medication, lifestyle changes, or a combination of approaches. The most important step is reaching out.</p>
